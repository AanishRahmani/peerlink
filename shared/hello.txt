Introducing My P2P File Sharing System

Iâ€™ve developed a P2P File Sharing System that allows secure and efficient file sharing over a local network. The system focuses on peer discovery, (versioning, access control, and manual auditing, to be developed) providing a seamless and decentralized solution for sharing files between devices.
Key Features:

    Discover each other automatically on the local network via mDNS.
    Share and sync files and folders.
    Track file versions in a Git-like CRDT model for conflict-free updates (work in progress).
    Transfer entire directories while maintaining structure.
    Ensure integrity through SHA-256 hash verification.
    Visualize transfer progress via a terminal progress bar.

Technologies Used:

    Golang

whats next:

Encryption â€” Encrypting the data stream using AES-256 along with encrypting the metadata file, the network over which the data is transferred, and the peer-to-peer protocol.
Public security key â€” Using a public key for authenticating that the right person is accessing the right network.
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) â€” Using a Public Access Key in the mDNS discovery so only authorized peers can join.
Request Queue (in progress) â€” Handling multiple simultaneous incoming file requests via a channel.
Queue Management Enhancements â€” Smarter backpressure control and retries.
Metadata Sync for every file imdividually â€” Improved CRDT for folder structures, not just files kind of like git.
Web UI for File Management â€” Beautiful browser-based dashboard.
